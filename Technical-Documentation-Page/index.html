                        <p>You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.Objects
                                are variables too. But objects
                                can contain many values.Objects can also have methods. Methods are actions that can be
                                performed on objects. Methods
                                are stored in properties as function definitions.In a function definition, this refers
                                to the "owner" of function.</p>

                        <p>In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function. In other
                                words, this.firstName means
                                the firstName property of this object. Read more about the this keyword at JS this
                                Keyword. This code assigns many values
                                (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car: This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to
                                variable:</p>
                        <code>var car = "Fiat";
                                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car;</code>

                        <p>Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the
                                most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate
                                them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of
                                substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring()
                                method.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sometimes, your code will include strings which are very long. Rather than having lines that
                                go on endlessly, or wrap at the whim of your editor, you may wish to specifically break
                                the string into multiple lines in the source code without affecting the actual string
                                contents. There are two ways you can do this.

                                You can use the + operator to append multiple strings or</p>
                        <code style="margin-left:300px;">var s_prim = 'foo';
                                var s_obj = new String(s_prim);</code>

                        <p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.owever, what if
                                you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3
                                cars, but 300?

                                The solution is an array!

                                An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by
                                referring to an index number.Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a
                                JavaScript Array.</p>

                        <p>You access an array element by referring to the index number.With JavaScript, the full array
                                can be accessed by referring to the array name:Arrays are a special type of objects.
                                The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

                                But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

                                Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". </p>
                        <code style="margin-left:385px;">var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</code>

                        <header>NUMBERS</header>
                        <p>JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without
                                decimals.Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent)
                                notation:Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different
                                types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.

                                JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers,
                                following the international IEEE 754 standard. </p>
                        <p>But in real life we usually avoid writing a long string of zeroes as itâ€™s easy to mistype.
                                Also, we are lazy. We will usually write something like "1bn" for a billion or "7.3bn"
                                for 7 billion 300 million. The same is true for most large numbers.

                                In JavaScript, we shorten a number by appending the letter "e" to the number and
                                specifying the zeroes count:</p>
                        <code style="margin-left:320px;">var x = 3.14; // A number with decimals
                                var y = 3; </code>

                        <p>An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

                                Here are some examples of HTML events:

                                An HTML web page has finished loading
                                An HTML input field was changed
                                An HTML button was clicked
                                Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

                                JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

                                HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML
                                elements.</p>
                        <p>Elements within a document can also be assigned event handlers. For example: ... Sometimes
                                we want to execute a JavaScript when an event occurs, such as when a user clicks a
                                button. Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will
                                not be executed before the event occurs!Event handlers can be used to handle, and
                                verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:
                                <ul style=" margin-left:360px;">
                                        <li>Things that should be done every time a page loads</li>
                                        <li>Things that should be done when the page is closed</li>
                                        <li>Action that should be performed when user clicks </li>
                                        <li>Content that should be verified when user inputs data</li>
                                        <li>And more ...</li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                        <code style="margin-left:480px;">a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;</code>
